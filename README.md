Welcome to my **Daily DSA Challenge Repository**!  
I’ve taken up the challenge to **learn, practice, and upload Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) in C++ every single day**.

Even if I don’t get time or fail to solve anything on a given day, I’ll still make a commit saying:

> _"Did nothing today, but I’ll be back tomorrow."_

This repo is my journey — a mix of code, progress, failures, and consistency. 💪

---

## 📌 Challenge Rules

1. **Learn / Practice** at least one DSA concept or problem each day.
2. **Commit daily** (progress or `"did nothing"`).
3. Use **C++** as the primary language.
4. Document important learnings along the way.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong foundations in **DSA**.
- Develop **problem-solving skills**.
- Maintain **consistency and discipline**.
- Prepare for **placements/interviews**.

## 📖 Progress Log

- day 1 : learnt 3 patterns
- day 2 : learnt 1 pattern
- day 3 : did nothing
- day 4 : learnt 5 patterns (18,19,20,21,22) so finished with patterns on this day
- day 5 : learnt basic maths - counting digits in number input
- day 6 : basic maths - reverse number , check palindrome also did my first 3 leetcode problems of my life
- day 7 : learnt just how to find a armstrong number , printing divisors (high complexity) day was very busy and hectic
- day 8 (23/09/25) - did nothing
- day 9 (24/09/25) - a small revision on the basic maths
- day 10 (25/09/25) - NOTHING !
- day 11 (26/09/25) - NOTHING !
- day 12 (27/09/25) - NOTHING !
- day 13 (28/09/25) - Prime Number , print divisors (using vector)
- day 14 (29/09/25) - NOTHING !
- day 15 (30/09/25) - NOTHING !
- day 16 (1/10/25) - Completed basic maths was little hard need a solid revision later but completed for now i can do it just for now
- day 17 (2/10/25) - Basic Recursion , stackoverflow , backtracking , little problems solving but yet not able to solve those questions on leetcode due to optimized cod
